## [0.13.0](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai/compare/v0.12.19...v0.13.0) (2026-05-24)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* model-invocable skill /do is renamed to /implement.
Same TDD-cycle behaviour, clearer verb.

- Atom: framework/atoms/do.md → framework/atoms/implement.md;
  frontmatter `name: do` → `name: implement`.
- Manifest: atoms.do → atoms.implement (source/target paths);
  ship composite phase `atom: do` → `atom: implement`.
- Target dir: framework/core/skills/do/ → framework/core/skills/implement/;
  .gitignore entry updated.
- Acceptance scenarios moved under skills/implement/acceptance-tests/;
  ids `do-*` → `implement-*`, skill="implement", userQuery "/implement ...",
  class names `Do*` → `Implement*`. Primitive-name refs in comments
  updated (`do executes` → ``implement` executes`, etc.); natural-English
  occurrences ("do NOT tell it", "what should we do") preserved.
- SRS: FR-ATOM-DO → FR-ATOM-IMPLEMENT (heading, ID, description body,
  acceptance scenario IDs); FR-SHIP five-atom list updated.
- SDS: §3.0 generation pipeline + commands/skills lists refreshed;
  §3.1.1 ship composite description renamed.
- README skill catalog: `do` row → `implement`.
- Documentation index: FR-ATOM-DO row → FR-ATOM-IMPLEMENT (alphabetical
  position preserved).
- framework/AGENTS.md: fixture template path repointed to
  framework/core/skills/implement/acceptance-tests/tdd-cycle-completes/.
- Task frontmatter: generate-skills-from-atoms.md `implements:`
  FR-ATOM-DO → FR-ATOM-IMPLEMENT (body narrative kept as historical).
- Cache cleanup: stale do-* and do-with-plan-* cache dirs git-rm'd.
- Smoke acceptance: `implement-tdd-cycle-completes` PASS under the
  renamed canon.

Full sweep deferred to user:
  deno task acceptance-tests -f implement
  deno task acceptance-tests -f ship
* removes /commit-beta and /do-with-plan slash commands.
Functionality preserved under /commit (renamed canon) and /ship respectively.

- Delete legacy `commit` standalone primitive (17 acceptance scenarios);
  migrate 16 universal-commit scenarios under the renamed canon (drop
  `suggest-reflect` — auto-invoke already covered by commit-beta scenario).
- Delete deprecated `do-with-plan` composite end-to-end: wrapper, 6
  acceptance scenarios, manifest entry, generator target.
- Rename atom `commit-beta` → `commit` (frontmatter `name`, manifest
  `atoms.commit`, source path, target path, .gitignore entry, example
  scope in `agent(commit): …`). Move 3 existing commit-beta acceptance
  scenarios under `commit/`; rebuild ids and userQuery slashes.
- Refresh docs: SRS FR-DO-WITH-PLAN marked [x] Removed; FR-REVIEW-COMMIT,
  FR-SHIP, FR-SKILL-COMPOSE, FR-JIT-REVIEW descriptions rewritten;
  SDS §3.0 Primitive Inventory + §3.1.1 composite descriptions
  refreshed (8→7 generated targets, 10→8 commands); README skill
  catalog and Documentation Map updated; `framework/AGENTS.md` template
  path repointed to a live fixture; `plan-exp-permanent-tasks` atom
  composite-example note updated.
- Fixture data: `scripts/check-skills_test.ts` composite-exemption
  tests swap `do-with-plan` → `ship`; `acceptance_discovery.ts`
  A/B comment refreshed.
- Cache cleanup: remove stale `commit-beta-*` cache dirs; smoke
  acceptance scenarios `commit-auto-invoke-reflect`, `commit-basic`,
  `review-and-commit-approve` all PASS under the renamed canon.

Full sweep deferred to user via:
  deno task acceptance-tests -f commit
  deno task acceptance-tests -f review-and-commit
  deno task acceptance-tests -f ship

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0) (2026-04-21)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** prefix-based orphan cleanup for framework sync
* **framework:** the following slash commands are renamed and now auto-invocable
by the model (users keep manual invocation via the new slash form):

- flowai-reflect                       -> flowai-reflect
- flowai-reflect-by-history            -> flowai-reflect-by-history
- flowai-review                        -> flowai-review
- flowai-plan                          -> flowai-plan
- flowai-epic                          -> flowai-epic
- flowai-investigate                   -> flowai-investigate
- flowai-maintenance                   -> flowai-maintenance
- flowai-adapt-instructions            -> flowai-adapt-instructions
- flowai-setup-agent-code-style-ts-deno   -> flowai-setup-agent-code-style-ts-deno
- flowai-setup-agent-code-style-ts-strict -> flowai-setup-agent-code-style-ts-strict

High-risk commands stay as user-only under commands/:
flowai-commit, flowai-commit-beta, flowai-review-and-commit,
flowai-review-and-commit-beta, flowai-init, flowai-update, flowai-adapt.

Each converted skill gets:
- Frontmatter description rewritten in "Use when ..." form with explicit
  Do-NOT gates to reduce spurious auto-invocation.
- A new no-spurious-invocation benchmark (10 in total) that asserts the
  model does NOT trigger the skill on adjacent out-of-scope requests.
- Co-located benchmark ids/skills renamed with the flowai- infix.

Cross-refs updated:
- Composite commands (commit, commit-beta, review-and-commit*, update)
  now reference /flowai-reflect, flowai-review, etc.
- SRS (documents/requirements.md), SDS (documents/design.md),
  documents/benchmarking.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, core pack.yaml,
  CLI tests (cli_test.ts, source_test.ts, sync_test.ts),
  scripts/check-naming-prefix_test.ts, scripts/check-pack-refs_test.ts,
  scripts/check-skill-sync.ts.
- cli/src/bundled.json regenerated via `deno task bundle`.

Verification:
- deno task check: 246 | 386 | 134 passed | 0 failed.
- All 7 validators green (check-skills, check-agents, check-skill-sync,
  check-pack-refs, check-naming-prefix, check-traceability,
  check-srs-evidence).
- Grep-guard: 0 stale path refs, 0 stale name-string refs outside
  historical task files.

NOTE: real benchmark runs (`deno task bench -f flowai-*` and
composite regression) were not executed in this commit — those are
LLM-judged and costly; run them separately before publish.

Implements: FR-PACKS.STRUCT, FR-PACKS.SKILL-INVARIANT, FR-HOWTO.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) (2026-04-19)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** `flowai` / `flowai sync` in a cwd without
`<cwd>/.flowai.yaml` but with `~/.flowai.yaml` now uses the global
config instead of creating a new project-local config. Opting a
project into local install requires creating `<cwd>/.flowai.yaml`
(e.g. via `flowai --local`). In `-y` mode with no configs on disk,
the CLI now generates a global config (was: project). `flowai
migrate` now refuses to run without an explicit scope flag.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
* **cli:** `flowai` and `flowai sync` no longer prompt to install
newer CLI versions. They print `Update available: X → Y. Run
`flowai update` to install.` and proceed. `flowai update` remains the
sole entry point that spawns `deno install`. Silent when up to date,
network-failing, or skipped via `--skip-update-check`.

## 0.8.0 (2026-04-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **framework:** framework/core/assets/ no longer ships
AGENTS.documents.template.md or AGENTS.scripts.template.md.
pack.yaml `assets:` map is now single-entry. Downstream
projects must run `/flowai-update` to collapse their legacy
three-file AGENTS.md layout; `flowai-update` detects the
legacy layout and guides a per-file confirmation merge.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
* All skill names changed from af-* to flow-*.
Commands like /af-commit are now /flow-commit.

Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>
* **rules:** Rule files moved from .mdc extension to RULE.md in directories.
Cursor IDE will automatically detect and load rules from new structure.

## 0.7.0 (2026-04-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **framework:** framework/core/assets/ no longer ships
AGENTS.documents.template.md or AGENTS.scripts.template.md.
pack.yaml `assets:` map is now single-entry. Downstream
projects must run `/flowai-update` to collapse their legacy
three-file AGENTS.md layout; `flowai-update` detects the
legacy layout and guides a per-file confirmation merge.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
* All skill names changed from af-* to flow-*.
Commands like /af-commit are now /flow-commit.

Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>
* **rules:** Rule files moved from .mdc extension to RULE.md in directories.
Cursor IDE will automatically detect and load rules from new structure.

### Features

* add 'fail fast' strategy to AGENTS rules ([8557845](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai/commit/855784514d0a54f89cfa03ee9141a3ec263cedc1))

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **framework:** framework/core/assets/ no longer ships
AGENTS.documents.template.md or AGENTS.scripts.template.md.
pack.yaml `assets:` map is now single-entry. Downstream
projects must run `/flowai-update` to collapse their legacy
three-file AGENTS.md layout; `flowai-update` detects the
legacy layout and guides a per-file confirmation merge.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
* All skill names changed from af-* to flow-*.
Commands like /af-commit are now /flow-commit.

Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>
* **rules:** Rule files moved from .mdc extension to RULE.md in directories.
Cursor IDE will automatically detect and load rules from new structure.
