# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction
- **Document purpose:** Define requirements for the AI-First IDE Rules and Commands project.
- **Scope:** A collection of Cursor rules and commands to standardize and enhance development workflows in AI-first IDEs (initially Cursor).
- **Audience:** Developers and AI agents working in Cursor.
- **Definitions and abbreviations:**
  - **IDE:** Integrated Development Environment.
  - **MCP:** Model Context Protocol.
  - **MDC:** Markdown Configuration (Cursor rules format).
  - **GODS:** Git Operations & Development Standards (framework).

## 2. General description
- **System context:** A set of configuration files (`.md`, `.mdc`) located in the `.cursor` directory of a project, interpreted by the Cursor AI agent to guide development, enforce rules, and execute workflows.
- **Assumptions and constraints:**
  - **Assumptions:** The user is using Cursor IDE. The project structure follows the defined conventions.
  - **Constraints:** functionality is limited by Cursor's rule capabilities and the agent's context window.

## 3. Functional requirements
### 3.1 Command Execution (FR-1)
- **Description:** The system must provide executable workflows for common development tasks, accessible via chat commands.
- **Use case scenario:** User types `/task-commit` to start a commit workflow. Agent reads the command file and follows the steps.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Support for 14 task commands including planning, execution, review, and documentation
  - [x] Commands follow `/task-*` naming convention
  - [x] Each command provides guided workflow with checklist

### 3.2 Rule Enforcement (FR-2)
- **Description:** The system must automatically apply development rules and coding standards.
- **Use case scenario:** Agent writes code. The system provides context on coding style (e.g., TypeScript, Swift) and principles (e.g., Zen, TDD).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Code style rules (TS, Swift, etc.).
  - [x] Development principles (Autonomous, Zen, TDD).
  - [x] Documentation standards.

### 3.3 Documentation Management (FR-3)
- **Description:** The system must define and enforce documentation schemas to maintain project knowledge.
- **Use case scenario:** Agent updates project documentation. The system ensures it follows the RDS-SDS or Cline-bank schema.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Support for different documentation schemas.
  - [x] Instructions for compact documentation.

### 3.4 Automation & How-To (FR-4)
- **Description:** The system must provide guides for complex or situational tasks.
- **Use case scenario:** User asks how to fix tests. Agent retrieves `howto-fix-tests.mdc` and follows the procedure.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Support for 10 how-to guides covering commit workflows, documentation, debugging, testing, Git operations, GitHub management, and GODS tasks
  - [x] Guides follow `howto-*` naming convention
  - [x] Each guide provides step-by-step instructions for specific scenarios

### 3.5 Project Maintenance (FR-5)
- **Description:** The system must provide automated project maintenance capabilities through scripts.
- **Use case scenario:** Developer runs `./run.ts check` to validate project integrity. Script performs linting, testing, and other checks.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Deno-based maintenance script (`run.ts`) with command-line interface
  - [x] Support for check, test, and dev commands
  - [x] Automated quality assurance workflows

## 4. Non-functional requirements
- **Performance:** Rules and commands must be concise to fit within the context window.
- **Reliability:** Instructions must be unambiguous to prevent agent hallucination or error.
- **Scalability:** The system must allow adding new commands and rules without breaking existing ones.
- **Usability:** Commands must be intuitive (e.g., `/task-*` prefix).

## 5. Interfaces
- **APIs and integrations:**
  - Cursor Chat: Primary interface for user-agent interaction.
  - File System: Storage for rules, commands, and documentation.
  - Git: Version control operations.
  - MCP: Integration with external tools (GitHub, etc.).
- **Protocols and data formats:** Markdown (`.md`, `.mdc`).
- **UI/UX constraints:** Text-based chat interface.

## 6. Acceptance criteria
- The system is considered accepted if the following are met:
  - All defined commands are executable by the Cursor agent.
  - Rules are correctly loaded and applied by the Cursor agent.
  - Documentation accurately reflects the project state.
