# Task Planning

## Overview
Create a clear, critiqued plan in `./documents/whiteboard.md` with options analysis and DoD, then stop for execution.

## Steps
1. **Preparation**
   - Read all docs in `./documents`
   - Analyze and restate the user query

2. **Problem analysis and research**
   - Collect all relevant information: source files, libraries, web, `.documents/remote_resources.md`, etc.

3. **Plan drafting in `whiteboard.md`**
   - Goal: Why are we performing the task? What is the business goal?
   - Overview: What is happening now? Why did the task arise? What is happening around it?
   - Definition of Done: acceptance criteria (include "`./run check` without errors and notices")
   - Implementation options: aggressive, conservative, balanced
   - For each option: pros/cons, short-/long-term consequences
   - Compare options, define selection strategy, select optimal or mixed solution

4. **Critique and rewrite**
   - Critique the plan directly in `whiteboard.md`
   - Rewrite the plan considering the critique
   - Remove the old version and critique from the file

5. **Stop**
   - End after planning; execution is separate
