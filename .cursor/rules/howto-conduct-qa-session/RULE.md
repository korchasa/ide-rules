# How to Conduct a Q&A Session

When you need to clarify requirements, gather missing information, or discuss design choices with the user, follow these strict guidelines.

## 1. Language
- **Match the User's Language**: Ask questions in the same language as the user's last query (e.g., Russian if the user asks in Russian), unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

## 2. Formatting & Structure
- **Number Your Questions**: Always use a numbered list for questions (1., 2., 3., ...).
- **Batch Size**: Ask **1 to 5 questions** per response. Do not overwhelm the user with too many questions at once.
- **Prioritize**: Start with the most critical or blocking questions first.

## 3. Content & Guidance
- **Provide Context**: Never ask a "naked" question. Add background information or context to help the user understand *why* you are asking.
- **Facilitate Decision Making**: Provide data or hints that make it easier for the user to answer.

## 4. Option Comparison
- **Compare Variants**: If asking the user to choose between options (A vs. B), explicitly compare them in the question description.
    - Highlight trade-offs (pros/cons).
    - Explain the impact of each choice.

## Example

**Bad:**
"Which database?"

**Good:**
"1. **Database Selection**: For the session storage, we have two main options. Which do you prefer?
    - **Redis**: Extremely fast, ideal for ephemeral data with TTL, but adds a new infrastructure dependency.
    - **PostgreSQL**: We already use it, simplifies the stack, but slightly slower for high-frequency reads/writes.
    
    *Recommendation: Start with Postgres for simplicity, migrate to Redis if load increases.*"
