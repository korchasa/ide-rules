## PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (PoC) MODE

- PoC is created **only** to validate a limited set of hypotheses and risks, not as a foundation for a production system.
- All participants must understand that PoC code **may be completely discarded**, and this is a normal, acceptable outcome.
- PoC has a strict timebox and implementation volume limit; any changes beyond the approved scope are rejected.
- Basic team development standards (code style, security, testing, TDD, etc.) remain mandatory unless these rules explicitly allow relaxations.

### Scope of responsibility
- Before starting PoC, it is mandatory to document:
  - hypothesis formulations,
  - success criteria (minimum 1–3 measurable metrics),
  - constraints on timelines, budget, and resources.
- Any task not tied to hypothesis validation and success criteria is **prohibited**.

### Architecture and code
- Architecture should be as simple as possible (monolithic, minimum number of services and technologies).
- It is prohibited to pre-design scalability, microservices, complex DevOps, and optimizations that are not needed for hypothesis validation.
- Implementation simplifications are allowed, but:
  - it is not allowed to introduce knowingly false solutions or "stubs" that distort hypothesis validation results,
  - it is not allowed to deliberately violate basic standards of quality, security, and confidentiality.
- PoC code is considered **disposable**: migration to production is possible only after separate design and rework.

### Quality, testing, and observability
- Only tests that protect logic parts critical to hypotheses are written; the goal is not maximum coverage, but reliable validation.
- Minimum sufficient logging and error handling are mandatory to interpret PoC results.
- Performance optimization is performed only if it directly affects the tested hypothesis or success criteria.

### Data and security
- Security and privacy priority **is not reduced** due to PoC status.
- Work with real user data is allowed only in the absence of alternatives and with compliance to all security and legal requirements.
- Confidential data, secrets, and keys are not stored in the repository, logs, and build artifacts.
- Integrations with external systems are replaced by test environments, sandbox environments, or strictly controlled API keys where possible.

### PoC process and completion
- Responsible parties for technical results and business results are assigned in advance for PoC.
- PoC results are documented: which hypotheses are confirmed/refuted, what limitations and risks are identified.
- Upon PoC completion, one of the following decisions is made:
  - stop (idea rejected),
  - conduct another PoC with refined hypotheses,
  - proceed to design and implementation of a production solution, **without** continuing PoC code development.

### Strictly prohibited in PoC
- Use PoC as a "backdoor" to introduce unagreed architecture or technologies into the production system.
- Replace real validations with "demo effect" where the demonstration result does not match the solution's actual capabilities.
- Ignore established success criteria by retroactively substituting them with more convenient formulations.
