### How to fix tests
1. Analyze errors: Review logs, error messages, and stack traces to identify the module or method where the failure occurs.
2. Isolate tests: Run only the failing tests separately to minimize noise and focus on the specific scenario.
3. Study tests: Examine the test code, comments, and descriptions to understand the expected behavior.
4. Review codebase: Locate the relevant sections of the code being tested and consult documentation, READMEs, or comments to grasp the overall architecture.
5. Reproduce issue: Create a minimal example that replicates the error to determine if it depends on specific data or configuration.
6. Create hypothes: Create the most likely hypothesis about the cause of the error.
7. Test hypothes: Methodically test the created hypothesis, making small, incremental changes and documenting each step.
8. If the hypothesis is not correct, create a new one and test it again.
9. If the hypothesis is correct, make the minimal changes to the code to fix the error.
